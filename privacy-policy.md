## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Develobile's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, VSApp.

We collect no information from users, each account is created automatically and anonymously.

You have the option to upload files to our server but no one else than you has access to them.

We use iCloud so your account is shared between your devices.

Your continued use of our app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us at [adrian@labbe.me](mailto:adrian@labbe.me).

This policy is effective as of 27 March 2020.
